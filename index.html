  	<h1 style="font-size: 450%;">Jeremy Lin funny story about Michael Jordan at the Hornets</h1><br>
  	<p>The documentary 'The Last Dance', which has been shown for many weeks, has shown the unique success of Michael Jordan during his time in the competition. However, when he retired and entered a new chapter of his basketball career, this nature remained unchanged.

As the owner of the Charlotte Hornets, Michael Jordan still regularly trash talks with the referees or bullies the players. This story has just been shared by Jeremy Lin, who used to play for the team of "Sir Air" in the 2015-16 season.</p>
	</div>
  <br>
	<div class="col">
  	<p>He recalls that at one game, Michael Jordan sat on a courtside chair to watch the Hornets play. Yet he also tried to put pressure on a referee.

"In the past when I was playing, you were terrible. You are still bad now! Are you going to 'swallow your whistle' all day?"

The other referee, when he heard it, turned to look and discovered that Michael Jordan had just trashed talk. Since then, he never dared to look back. In the latter part of the season, the Hornets are losing 4 games in a row. So Jordan showed up at the next training session to meet the players.

He told stories about the Chicago Bulls that Jeremy Lin could not remember. But he remembers a sentence that goes to MJ's heart: "Solve your problems and stop making me fly up here from Florida".

"No matter what point in life, Michael Jordan will still be an extremely fierce loser. It is truly my honor to play for his team," Jeremy Lin added. In 2006, Michael Jordan acquired a small share of the Charlotte Bobcats (the predecessor of the Hornets). In 2010, he became the main owner before the team officially changed its name to the Charlotte Hornets in 2014.

Success in his career is like that, but in the tasks related to team leadership, Michael Jordan has not left any mark.

Even so, he still knows how to inspire or... pressure his players.In 1991, for the first time the NBA Championship, the entire Chicago Bulls team was invited to the White House as is customary. However, Michael Jordan was suddenly absent without any reason. It took an investigation by the federal government to find out where the legend born in 1963 was at that time.

At that time, Jordan was actually playing golf with James "Slim" Bouler, a notorious drug lord in the United States. When Bouler was arrested for money laundering, police discovered a check for $57,000. Originally, the Chicago Bulls legend said it was a loan. It was not until he went to court that he admitted it was money from a 1991 golf bet.</p>
